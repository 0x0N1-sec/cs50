# cs50
I am self-teaching programming/computer science &amp; cybersecurity (with a web2/web3 concentration). My ultimate goal is to work as an independent smart contract auditor.  CS50 is my first step in this pursuit.  I will be completing all courses (X, P, AI, SQL, W, SEC, G) after which I will complete Full Stack Open to make sure I am up-to-date!
