This is the main hub of CS50 which introduces the disciplines of computer science and programming to students.  I am using it as my main course of study in programming (though I will be doing a separate curriculum of computer science/math courses from Berkeley & MIT to fully develop my mathematical and computer science maturity).  I will be doing all CS50 courses to round out myself as a programmer - as well as the fact that they are project-based and provide good ideas on what types of projects to focus on.  My goal is to become a web2 application security researcher and web3 smart contrat auditor and I would also like to develop my own video game at some point (which is why I am also doing CS50G).  The path to complete CS50 is as follows:

- Begin CS50:
	- Week 0: Scratch (complete project)
	- Week 1: C (complete pset)
	- Week 2: Arrays (complete pset)
	- Week 3: Algorithms (complete pset)
	- Week 4: Memory (complete pset)
	- Week 5: Data Structures (complete pset)
	- Week 6: Python (complete pset then break to do CS50P)
	- Week 6.5: AI (complete pset then break to do CS50AI)
	- Week 7: SQL (complete pset then break to do CS50SQL)
	- Week 8: HTML, CSS, & JavaScript (complete pset)
	- Week 9: Flask (complete pset then break to do CS50W)
	- Week 10: Cybersecurity (complete pset then break to do CS50SEC)
	- Weeks 11 - 12: Complete Final Project then do Full Stack Open

This is my self-taught "programming bootcamp" for web 2.  I will be doing this from about 9am - 9pm daily in parallel with my CS/Math deep-dive from 6am-9am.  I will also be throwing TryHackMe and PortSwigger Web Security Academy in there along with all of this.  During Full Stack Open I will begin Alchemy University to start my transition to web3 at which point I will introduce the second phase to my roadmap. By this time I should have a good handle on programming (with a good portfolio), mathematics through calculus, and the foundations of cybersecurity and web application security research.  This will put me in a prime position to learn web3/smart contract development and auditing.
